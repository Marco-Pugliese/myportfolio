              <span className="color-change-2y fs-5">Marco Pugliese</span> , a
              31-year-old front-end developer. I'm deeply passionate about Tech,
              Basketball, and Music. In each of these fields, I firmly believe
              that the key to expressing oneself is simplicity â€” being Minimal.

              Originally from Procida (Na) - Italy, I had the privilege of
              growing up with a sports-oriented education, shaping my
              perspective on the world in a collective and team-oriented way. My
              love for music has taken me to many places allowing me to connect
              with people from all around the world. Additionally, my early
              experiences as a chef provided me with the opportunity to live and
              work in different countries!

              With expertise in front-end development, my skills encompass the
              fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, extending to the latest
              advancements in development, such as SASS, React.js, and React
              Native. I excel in integrating satellite capabilities and
              frameworks. Specializing in crafting responsive and user-friendly
              interfaces that adhere to the principles of minimalism, I am adept
              at translating complex ideas into elegant and functional designs.
              This proficiency forms the core of my skill set.

              I value efficiency, collaboration, and continuous learning. The
              ever-evolving nature of technology motivates me to stay updated
              and adapt my skills to meet emerging challenges. Collaboration is
              key to my approach, as I believe diverse perspectives lead to
              innovative solutions.

              Looking ahead, my goal is to grow as much as I can as a developer
              and be an example for younger developers. Whether it's exploring
              new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or further
              refining my design skills, I am dedicated to continuous growth in
              my field."
